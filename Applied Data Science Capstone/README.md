Final Course - Capstone Project

SpaceX, substantially inexpensive compared to other spacecraft engineering companies, is able to save millions of dollars by reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets. With the help of data science, this project aims to help a competing company determine the cost of each launch by assuring that the first stage has a successful launch or an unsuccessful one.
